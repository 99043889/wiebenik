    <h3>Algemeen Omschrijving</h3>

    <p>My name is Louis, but people who is close to me calls me Kareem. I was born in Saint-Martin (French part) in the year of 1995.</p>
    <p>The same year Hurricane Louis struck the island, which was the worst hurricane to ever hit the island. A few years after I moved to Curacao and after 2 years living in Curacao my mom decided to move to Aruba. So basically I lived much of life in Aruba. I am the oldest of my siblings.</p>
    <p>Now I am living in The Netherlands to pursue one of my dreams and that is to start my own tech startup. I come from a family that is in ICT so yeah it is in my blood.</p>
    <p>Aside from school I make music. I am an hip-hop artist and music is my passion. Although, I make urban music I listen to all genres aslong it sounds dope. I did a few shows already around Aruba and soon will be doing shows in Holland.</p>

    <p>I have skills in music production, songwriting and a bit of audio engineering. I also have a skill in fixing computers.</p>

    <h3>Studies</h3>
    <p>In Aruba I finished my Mavo and attented Havo after. Unfortunately, I was not able to pass my final exams and lost total interest in Havo so now I am here in Holland doing MBO.</p>

    <h3>Werkervaring</h3>
    <p>I never worked for anyone, because I like to think of myself as being my own boss, a CEO. I make money doing music, whether it is shows, features, graphic designing (artwork), photography, co-producing or recording other artists. That is how I make money.</p>
    <p>In the past, I start my own small business fixing computers, phones, tablets or cracking and updating electronics. But, that did not work out. It was not the best market at the moment.</p>
